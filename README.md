# ES6 generators

These are some quick notes/experiments with es6 generators written as I was following along with [this Pony Foo blog post](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-generators-in-depth).

If you'd like to play around with the code, clone the repo and `npm install`.  Then `npm start` and the output should show in your terminal.  The code is roughly separated by section in `index.js` so feel free to comment out some of the function calls if you'd prefer to only see part of the output.
